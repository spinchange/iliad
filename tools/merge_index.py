"""Phase 3 merge + validation: assemble the writers' slices into one index.

Reads the per-slice worklists (`index/entries/_worklist-NN.md`) for the
authoritative ordered headword list each writer was given, splits each writer's
output (`index/entries/entries-NN.md`) on `---` separators, and aligns them
positionally — so a missing or extra entry surfaces immediately instead of
silently shifting every later entry onto the wrong headword.

Checks:
  * coverage — every worklist headword has exactly one entry, none extra;
  * citations — every `book.line` an entry cites is a real occurrence of that
    headword (from `registry.json`); anything else is flagged for human review
    (advisory: a verified scene-line need not be an occurrence line).

If coverage is clean it writes the merged, alphabetized `index/index.md`.

Usage:  python tools/merge_index.py
