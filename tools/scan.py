"""Deterministic dactylic-hexameter checker for the Greek text.

This is a *verifier*, not a scanner-of-record: it does not claim to produce the
one true scansion of a line. It asks a decidable question — "does at least one
metrically legal reading of this line exist as a dactylic hexameter?" — and
answers yes/no by search over the positions that Greek prosody leaves free.

Quantities that are fixed by the writing system are treated as fixed:
  - naturally long:  η ω, and the diphthongs (αι αυ ει ευ ηυ οι ου υι + iota
    subscripts ᾳ ῃ ῳ), and any vowel bearing a circumflex.
  - naturally short: ε ο.
  - "position": a short vowel followed by two consonants (across word
    boundaries too) is heavy. ζ ξ ψ count as double; a mute+liquid cluster
    (π,β,φ,τ,δ,θ,κ,γ,χ + λ,ρ,μ,ν) is treated as *optionally* making position,
    since epic allows either — so it becomes a free choice in the search.
  - dichrona (α ι υ without a circumflex) are genuinely ambiguous by spelling;
    they are left free and the search picks whatever the meter needs.

A line "scans" if some assignment of the free quantities yields the classic
pattern: five feet each dactyl (– ‿ ‿) or spondee (– –), then a final foot of
two syllables (– –  or – ‿, the anceps). That is exactly 17 down to 13 metrical
positions, so the syllable count alone must land in [13, 17]; the search
confirms the fixed quantities don't contradict any valid footing.

Usage:
    python scan.py greek/book-01.txt        # check one file
    python scan.py greek/*.txt              # check many
    python scan.py --verbose greek/book-09.txt   # show why lines fail

On Murray's text this reports ~95% of lines as scannable. The ~5% residual is
not noise and not (as far as tested) a modelling bug: it is the set of lines
whose scansion depends on facts the written text does not carry, and which a
text-only rule therefore cannot see —
  - digamma: a lost initial ϝ (e.g. ἥν < ϝήν, οἶνος < ϝοῖνος) still makes
    position, lengthening a preceding short syllable that looks light on paper;
  - synizesis: two written vowels sung as one syllable (θεοί, πόλιος, Πηληϊάδεω),
    which changes the syllable count itself;
  - metrical lengthening and proper-name licence.
A flagged line is thus often an interesting line, not a wrong one. Treat 95% as
the regression baseline: a sudden drop means the prosody model broke, not that
Homer did.
